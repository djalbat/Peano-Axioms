MetaVariable P(Nat)

Variables n,k:Nat

ProofVariables p,q,r

Rule (P9,Induction)
  Premises
    P(0)
    P(k) => P(k+1)
  Conclusion
    P(n)
  Proof
    n=0 âˆ¨ n=k+1
    Suppose
      n=0
    Hence
      P(0)
      p is a proof of P(0)
      P(0) from p0
    Therefore
      P(n)
    n=0 => P(n)

    Suppose
      n=k+1
    Hence
      P(k) => P(k+1)
      q is a proof of P(k) => P(k+1)
      ps(k) is a proof of P(k)
      Hence
        P(k+1) by ps(k+1)

    Therefore
      P(n)
    n=k+1 => P(n)

  Therefore
    P(n) by ProofByCases

Theorem (p0)
  Premise
    p is a proof of P(0)
  Conclusion
    P(0)
  Proof
    P(0) from p

Theorem (ps(k+1))
  Premises
    q is a proof of P(k) => P(k+1)
    r is a proof of P(k)
  Conclusion
    P(k+1)
  Proof
    P(k) => P(k+1) from q
    P(k) from r
  Therefore
    P(k+1) from ModusPonens
