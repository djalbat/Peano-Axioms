# Peano Axioms

Peano axioms for the [Occam](http://djalbat.com/occam) proof assistant.

In fact this package contains lemmas corresponding to the Peano axioms that have been *derived* from the construction of the natural numbers in the [natural numbers](https://openmathematics.org/#natural-numbers) package.

## Notes

* The derivation of the axiom of induction is deserving of a separate explanation and can therefore be found in the [induction](https://openmathematics.org/#induction) package.
